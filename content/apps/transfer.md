# WeTransfer
"WeTransfer is the simplest way to send (and receive) big files. Whether you’re at your desk or on the go, transfer up to 200 GB in one go. That’s about 2000 videos of your cat. With WeTransfer, you can check the download status, forward, and delete transfers right from your phone. Get notified the minute you receive something and preview (or download) your files wherever you are."
