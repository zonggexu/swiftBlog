Almost everything on mixedCase.nl needs to come from the database: the...

					My sixth book review, and the second one about iPhone development. The previous book was a great read, but since it only talked about the basics it left me wanting for (much) more. I needed more information about searchbars, core data, multitouch and the accelerometer. This time I actually read some reviews before buying a new book, and &quot;Beginning iPhone 3 Development&quot; seemed like a winner.

					In a previous blogentry I wrote about some great online resources I found to get started with iPhone development. I read the C and Objective-C introductions, watched the first 12 or so episodes of the Stanford courses and did the assignments that went along with it. Well, at least I tried to do all the assignments, but they were not easy with just the information from the taped lectures. There is a ton of information in them, but are kind of boring to watch, and you don&apos;t learn that well from slides.

					I bought this book, hoping it would give tips and hints on making effective user interfaces, what works best, what tools to use, how to make effective wireframes, give example screenshots, etc. Let me tell you this first: it&apos;s not that kind of book. Instead, this book is about educating you on the advantages of a good user experience (UX), how to generate support (buy-in) from your stakeholders and even a bit about agile methods.
